What this project is about:
---------------------------

This is a VHDL implementation of the Bandai 2001 / 2003 chip found in all official WonderSwan Cartridge. It will ultimately provide a fully functional clone of the Bandai chip.

* What does that mean:
 * You can use this code to program your own CPLD
 *  You can build your own cartridge that use this CPLD (and you can even sell them!)
 *  But you can't program CPLD and sell them directly
 *  You are welcome to propose patch for supporting another CPLD or correct bugs
 *  You can't integrate this code with another CPLD of FPGA project

*If you have any doubt, please contact me I will be happy to help you*
